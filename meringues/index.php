			<h2>Ingredients</h2>

			<h2>Prep</h2>
			<p>Separate the egg yolks from the <span class="item-1">egg white</span>. Use the egg yolks to create <a href="../chocolate-mud/">Dark Stragiatella Mud</a>, <a href="../hamburgers/">hamburgers</a>, or <a href="../mashed-potatoes/">mashed potatoes</a>. Heat the oven to 140°C. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.</p>
			<h2>Cooking</h2>
			<p>Whisk the <span class="item-1">egg white</span> with an electric mixer. First slowly, but turn up the speed after a minute or so. </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					If you lift the whisk attachment out of the bowl, the mixture should look fluffy and cling to it, while the peaks remain stiff and moist-looking
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>While you’re still mixing, add the <span class="item-2">sugar</span> slowly, sprinkling it into the egg white from a spoon, until the mixture is stiff and glossy. This could take a while. No need to hurry.</p>
			<p>Put the mixture into a large pastry bag and plot as many dots as you can onto the baking trays.</p>
			<p>Put the tray in the oven. Wait. After 30 minutes they should be about done. They’re done when they’re dry from the outside and can be easily removed from the tray.</p>
