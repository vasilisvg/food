			<h2>Prep</h2>
			<p>Preheat the oven to 250–275°C (which is very hot, this takes some time).</p>
			<p>Mix the <span class="item-3">garlic</span>, <span class="item-4">thyme</span>, <span class="item-5">pepper, salt</span> and <span class="item-2">olive oil</span>. Massage this mixture all over the meat.</p>

			<h2>Cooking</h2>
			<p>Put the <span class="item-1">pork tenderloins</span> in a roasting pan, just big enough so they <em>almost</em> touch each other. Place the pan near the bottom of your oven. After 10 minutes turn them. After 8 minutes — or when the internal temperature is at 68°C — take them out of the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes — the temperature should be 71°C now.</p>
			<p>Slice them up, and serve with <a href="../mashed-potatoes/">mashed potatoes</a>. If you add some water to the tray and scrape the bottom, you have a simple, yet tasty sauce.</p>
