			<h2>Prep</h2>
			<p>Aks the fish seller to clean the <span class="item-1">fish</span>. Cover the <span class="item-1">dorade</span> with a very thick layer of <span class="item-2">salt</span>. Put it in a colander and place it in the fridge. You want to place a plate under the collander. The <span class="item-1">fish</span> will leak.</p>

			<h2>Cooking</h2>
			<p>Put the <span class="item-1">fish</span> (with its <span class="item-2">salt</span> crust) on the bbq. Turn it around. Repeat until it’s done. Somebody once told me that the fish is done when the colour of the big bone on the inside changes to white. I never tried it, I just take a good guess.</p>
			<p>I always use a stainless steal fish basket so it doesn't stick to the grate. And this way my friends who eat halal can eat the fish as well, while the rest of my friends eat <a href="../drunken-pig/">drunken pig</a> and <a href="../hamburgers/">hamburgers</a> from the same bbq.</p>
