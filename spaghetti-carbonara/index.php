			<h2>Prep</h2>
			<p>Put the <span class="item-1">eggs</span> and the <span class="item-2">egg yolk</span> until well blended. Add the <span class="item-3">cheese</span> and quite some <span class="item-6">pepper</span> and stirr well.</p>
			<p>Heat the <span class="item-4">bacon</span> slowly until much of the fat is rendered and the meat has browned a little. This can take up to 20 minutes. Put a lid on it when it looks like it’s finished. Use a large pan, later on you want to add the <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span>.</p>
			<p>If the <span class="item-5">peas</span> are fresh, cook them. If they only need to be heated, don’t.</p>
			<p>Cook the <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span> with quite some salt</p>
			<p>When the <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span> is done you need: the colander on a ceramic bowl, the <span class="item-5">peas</span> in the colander, two wooden spoons, the baked <span class="item-4">bacon</span>, and the <span class="item-1">egg</span> and <span class="item-3">cheese</span> mixture, all at hand.</p>

			<h2>Cooking</h2>
			<p>Make sure everything is in place. These steps take not more than a minute.</p>
			<p>Pour the <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span> into the collander. This will heat up the <span class="item-5">peas</span>, and heat up the ceramic bowl. Heat is important since you’re working with raw <span class="item-1">eggs</span>.</p>
			<p>Pour the <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span> and the <span class="item-5">peas</span> into the pan with the <span class="item-4">bacon</span>. Don’t shake the collander, you want the <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span> to stay wet. Stir a few times, you want to coat the <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span> with fat.</p>
			<p>Pour out the water from the ceramic bowl, but do keep 200 ml or so. Pour the mixture of <span class="item-7">spaghetti</span>, <span class="item-5">peas</span> and <span class="item-4">bacon</span> into the bowl. Now pour the mixture of <span class="item-1">eggs</span> over it and immediately start stirring well. If needed, add some of the water you saved to make the sauce more juicy. Serve right away.</p>
			<p>You can use the leftover egg white to create <a href="../meringues/">meringues</a>.</p>
