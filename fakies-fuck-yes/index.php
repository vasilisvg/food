			<h2>What?</h2>
			<p>A long time ago when I was 18 I spent a summer with a bunch of punks on an island in Greece. One day we decided to make lentil soup. And we were all pretty excited about it because it tastes to nice. So all day long we told each other how much we like lentils, and how happy we were that tonight we would eat lentils. The Greek word for lentils is <em>fakiès</em>. There was this English girl who, after a while, asked us what the incredible thing was we were talking about. All she heard all day was <em>mumblemumble, fuck yes! Mumblemumble, fuck yes!</em></p>
			<p>As a student I used to eat this every month. Back then I always had some leftover days when all the money was gone, and this soup is perfect to overcome this problem.</p>
			<h2>Prep</h2>
			<p>Chop the <span class="item-2">onions</span>, press the <span class="item-3">garlic</span>, wash the <span class="item-4">lentils</span>.</p>

			<h2>Cooking</h2>
			<p>Put <span class="item-1">olive oil</span> in a pan over medium heat. If you want to you can add the <span class="item-8">oregano</span> right now, but some people think you should add the <span class="item-8">oregano</span> only at the very end, right before the soup is ready to be served. Both are fine. After a minute or so, add the <span class="item-2">onions</span>. You can add the <span class="item-3">garlic</span> a little later.</p>
			<p>After five minutes or so put the pan on high heat and add the <span class="item-4">lentils</span>. Stir. Add five times as much <span class="item-5">water</span> as lentils.</p>
			<p>Now add the <span class="item-6">laurel leaves</span>, the <span class="item-7">salt and the pepper</span>. Let it simmer for an hour, and stir occasionaly. Add more <span class="item-5">water</span> if necessary. If you didn’t add the <span class="item-8">oregano</span> in the beginning, you should add it right before it’s done.</p>
			<p>Put the soup into bowls. Add a spoonful of <span class="item-9">vinegar</span> to each bowl. Some people prefer <span class="item-9">lemon</span>, which is nice as well.</p>
