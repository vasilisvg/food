			<h2>Prep</h2>
			<p>Put the ice machine in the fridge at least 24 hours before you start. Break the chocolate into small pieces. Separate the egg yolks from the egg white.</p>
			<h2>Cooking</h2>
			<p>Whisk the <span class="item-1">egg yolks</span> together with the <span class="item-2">sugar</span> and the <span class="item-3">cornflour</span> until it’s a nice, sticky schlop. Keep the egg white to make <a href="../meringues/">meringues</a>.</p>
			<p>Heat up the <span class="item-4">milk</span> until <em>right before it cooks</em>. Now slowly pour it into the egg-schlop while you keep stirring.Heat up this mixture again right until it becomes thick. Take it off the heat right away, or it will turn into a rather disgusting scrambled egglike blobby thing. Break <span class="item-5">200 grams of chocolate</span> into little pieces and mix it into the custard until it’s all melted. Put the custard in the fridge and wait until it’s cold.</p>
			<p>Wait</p>
			<p>Take out the cold custard, mix it well with the cold <span class="item-6">cream</span>. Now, pour it into the ice cream maker and turn it on immediately.</p>
			<p>Melt the remaining <span class="item-5">100 grams of chocolate</span>. Au-bain-marie is the best way to do this. At the moment when the custard in the ice machine starts to become more <em>icecream-like</em> pour the liquid chocolate into the ice cream maker. It will break into small pieces of chocolate. When the ice cream is done, serve it right away — with or without <a href="../meringues/">meringues</a> — and eat it all.</p>
